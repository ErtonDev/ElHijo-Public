**ElHijo-Public** contains the scripts for my multifunctional discord bot *El Hijo* (Code is mostly in spanish, but I'll try to explain everything here as best as I can). I designed *El Hijo* for my friend's discord server as a fun way to add some administration and entertainment elements to the server. The project that once started as a short 100 lines script that answered you if you typed 'Hi' slowly became a 2000 lines beast with functions like:

1. Administration tools for specific server roles
2. Personal *El Hijo* accounts to save bot-person related data
3. An investing simulator with fictional stocks to win bot's credits (stored in your account)
4. A casino with games to spend bot's credits
5. And lots of other commands to enhance the bot's overall capabilities
